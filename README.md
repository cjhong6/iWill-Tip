## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:
* [x] A pickerView to select how many people split the total amount.
* [x] A clear button to clear bill amount, tip amount, split amount and total amount.
* [x] Add a light/dark color theme to the settings view. In viewWillAppear, update views with the correct theme colors.

## Notes
The changllenge that I ran to are the new knowledge of Swift language adn xcode. So I joined the MobileSpace program to get a general idea of programming in IOS app. After few weeks of thie program, it comes a smooth transition to do this tip calculator project but I still need to learn more IOS programming.
